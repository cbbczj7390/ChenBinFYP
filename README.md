# ChenBinFYP: Image Recognition System with YOLOv5 & ResNet50

## 🚀 Features

1. **Single and Batch Image Upload**: Upload one or multiple images and get results in a structured format.

2. **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 to detect objects within the uploaded images.

3. **Similarity Search**: Compares the uploaded images to those stored in the database using ResNet50 features.

4. **User-Friendly UI**: A modern, responsive design using Bootstrap.

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Upload Single Image**: Use the "Upload Single Image" option to upload one image for object detection and similarity search.
2. **Upload Multiple Images**: Use the "Upload Multiple Images" option to upload several images at once, and results for each image will be displayed sequentially.

pip install Flask

1. Ensure Dependencies are Installed
Install the necessary libraries if you haven’t already:
pip install Flask tensorflow keras numpy pillow

1. Install Homebrew
Run the following command in your terminal to install Homebrew:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Add Homebrew to Your PATH
Run these commands in your terminal:
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/chenbin/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

Verify Homebrew Installation
Check if Homebrew is now available by running:
brew --version

Next Step: Install MySQL
Now that Homebrew is set up, install MySQL:
brew install mysql


🚀 Step-by-Step Guide for Object Detection Integration with YOLOv5

We will:
	1.	Set up YOLOv5 for object detection.
	2.	Modify your Flask app to detect objects in uploaded images.
	3.	Display detected objects with bounding boxes.
	4.	Integrate object detection results with the similarity comparison.
